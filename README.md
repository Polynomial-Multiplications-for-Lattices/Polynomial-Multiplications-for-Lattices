# Polynomial-Multiplications-for-Lattices

This repository collects several tricks for polynomial multiplications that have found practical importance in lattice-based cryptosystems.
In the literature, researchers argued the efficiency of specific approaches multiplying polynomials on certain platforms.
Since hardware improves overtime, we eventually need to transfer the knowledge to future platforms.
There are two parts in this repository:
- A collection of C implementations demonstrating each of the tricks.
- A collection of implementations with platform-specific optimizations explaining how researchers optimized for the target platforms.
